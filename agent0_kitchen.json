Happy change the order or we could add explicit functions for each storage type e.g. `giveFeedbackIPFS` & `giveFeedbackArweave`\n\nAs for the subgraph, I think the graph has decent support for Arweave given it's use in NFTs etc. but I've never created one before myself. I can take another look tomorrow but if @itsjerryokolo could take a look or confirm it should work that would be really helpful"

I will be following this for now when implementing the standard into the Agent0 sdk and into my own search provider, but please give suggestions for improvement!\n2. Built a demo erc8004 explorer (https://agent0search.dawidpisarczyk.com/) using my semantic search api if anyone wants to check it out, also has docs on how to use the api, please let me know if theres any problems with it! Indexing occurs on 15 minute intervals currently. The site and the api will be open sourced soon under agent0"

Maybe @itsjerryokolo could take a look, my point of view on that one is that the subgraph might not actually support that usage of Arweave, which would be a shame if that is still the case today. I know Arweave support on subgraph has been very weak unfortunately, so from my point of view that one is currently blocked by The Graph's support of Arweave functionality, but perhaps I am wrong"

    "text": "Thanks again for reviewing the PR. I totally appreciate the thoughtful questions. We anchored the work on Registry Broker because it’s the discovery + messaging layer we’ve been building at HOL for the past year for agents (hol.org/registry). Every agent that registers or gets indexed via adapters like ERC‑8004 ends up with a canonical UAID, searchable profile, encryption metadata, broker‑managed chat sessions, and, when needed, x402 hooks.\n  \nThe SDK helpers simply surface that so a developer can search, verify, negotiate encryption, settle x402 if required, and start chatting without standing up extra infrastructure.\n\n  Here’s why we leaned into the broker path:\n\n  1. Reachability: Most ERC‑8004 agents live behind tunnels, mobile devices, or scheduled jobs. The broker gives them a rendezvous point with presence tracking and retries, which means callers don’t need bespoke NAT workarounds.\n  2. Stateful conversations: As soon as chats span more than one request, teams ask for resumable sessions, transcripts, encrypted payloads, TTL enforcement, and occasionally x402 payments. The broker already supplies those behaviors; rebuilding them inside each SDK would be fragile and adds lots of surface area to maintain.\n  3. Shared registry data: The same service that powers vector search, trust signals, UAID validation, and payment policies also knows how to route messages and settle x402. Leaning on that keeps the SDK thin while still meeting enterprise expectations.\n  4. Ready today: hol.org’s cluster represents a year of monitoring, scaling, adapter work, encryption, and x402 support. Decentralized nodes are coming, but the hosted broker is available right now, so teams can build on it immediately.\n\n  Nothing prevents you from resolving a UAID and hitting a public HTTPS endpoint directly if that suits your deployment. Our experience, though, is that most teams don’t want to expose raw endpoints or re‑implement stateful messaging and payments. The broker gives us one well‑documented path to discover agents, negotiate encryption, initiate chat, and settle (including x402) when needed. That’s the adoption story we’re championing, and the Agent0 SDK now plugs straight into it."

Yeah, you need a vector db, re-index, run embeddings, not straightforward...\n2) @MonteCrypto0 suggests to only include the reader in the SDK (zero complexity), and create a separate repo for the backend (that we could also run as a SaaS x402-gated). In this way we don't add in the client/SDK repo the complexity of the server, which is relevant only for a very minor fraction of developers. Wdyt? Pros/cons? @Dawe00 Wdyt?"

What's a RegistryBroker? A messaging server? It seems to me a pretty opinionated approach. General question, do we need a messaging server? What if we assume the receiver of the message always has a public IP reachable from the A2A endpoint? And we don't provide any message history retrieval (stateless) or maybe just a copy locally where the SDK is running. In this way we just do peer to peer messaging without persistent sessions. And we don't need to depedent on any backend. Wdyt? Cons of this approach?"

The currrent implementation for feedback is generic ( `giveFeedback` ), assumes IPFS/pinata and is paid for by the client.\n\nI think the client paying for stoage is required as otherwise it would be a security vulnerability (??) however a few questions re best approach:\n\n1. Should we update feedback method to more explicitly specify storage provider inline with registration? (e.g. `giveFeedbackIPFS` | `giveFeedbackArweave` ) alternative is continuing with current pattern and extending if/else statements\n\n2. Should the agent be able to require a specific storage provide for feedback or leave this up to the client?"

I’m discussing this with @Dawe00 .\n\nImport from centralized MCP catalogs\n- Is anyone interested in collaborating on this?\n\nBetter x402 support\n- There’s a lot we can do this year—for example, give Agent0 a spending wallet so it can pay any x402 service. The product direction is still open; if someone wants to help, let me know.\n\nAgent communications (A2A)\n- Product direction is still open. The idea is to provide Agent0 endpoints to send and receive agent-to-agent (A2A) messages.\n\nReachability watchtower\n- A major issue in the industry is that agents’ endpoints aren’t reliably reachable. Proposal: a watchtower that pings each endpoint weekly, checks for HTTP 200, and uses 8004 feedback to update a binary status: “Reachable” / “Not reachable”."
